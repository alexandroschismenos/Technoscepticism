Artificial Intelligence and Barbarism: A Critique of Digital Reason, by Alexandros Schismenos
As artificial intelligence rapidly reshapes every facet of human existence, a groundbreaking new book, Artificial Intelligence and Barbarism: A Critique of Digital Reason, by Alexandros Schismenos, challenges the prevailing narrative of technological progress. Published by Athens School, this timely work argues that the uncritical embrace of digital reason risks ushering in a new era of "digital barbarism," where human autonomy and critical thought are subtly eroded by algorithmic control and pervasive "mythinformation."
Schismenos’ critique delves into the philosophical underpinnings of AI, exposing how its seemingly neutral logic can mask mechanisms of political control and reshape our understanding of truth and reality. The book offers a vital counter-narrative to techno-utopian visions, urging readers to critically examine the societal implications of AI beyond its immediate functionalities. It posits that true progress requires a re-evaluation of our relationship with technology, emphasizing humanistic values over purely computational efficiency.
The author identifies two prevalent and often opposing societal responses to AI: "technophilia," characterized by an uncritical belief in AI's promises and its capacity to enhance human life, and "technophobia," defined by a fearful rejection of AI due to concerns about human enslavement to machines. The book’s central contribution lies in its proposal of an "intermediate path," termed "technoskepticism." The book is structured across four chapters:
○ Chapter One meticulously examines technoskepticism as a socio-historical critique of technology.
○ Chapter Two delves into the metaphysical foundations of AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as a scientific program.
○ Chapter Three offers a critical challenge to the prevailing ideology of AI as solely a corporate capitalist venture.
○ Chapter Four articulates a vision for overcoming "digital barbarism" and advancing towards a future characterized by democratic digital humanism.
